# British Airways Review Dashboard

## Project Overview
This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes passenger reviews of British Airways, focusing on various in-flight experience categories. It enables quick insights into review patterns by aircraft, seat type, traveler demographics, and geography and to explore and present **average customer review scores** across multiple service categories and breakdowns, helping identify what aspects of British Airways’ service stand out or need improvement.
